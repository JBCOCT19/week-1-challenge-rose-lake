# Week 1 Challenge Pseudo-Code

## PART 1

the introduction:
	1a. welcome the user to the program
	1b. ask the user for input greater than 1
	1c. take in the user input into an INTEGER type
	1d. clear the keyboard for next use (the end of line).

the process:
	IF: Check that the user entered a number greater than `1`.
		IF: First, check if the user entered TWO. This is a special case. If yes, print it is prime.
		ELSE: Do the actual checking for a prime number here:
			
			LOOP: COUNTER starts at 2. COUNTER goes up to NUMBER/2. COUNTER increments by 1.
				IF: check if NUMBER % COUNTER equals ZERO. 
					if so, number is not prime.
					print out message.
					set boolean flag IS_PRIME to false.
					BREAK out of LOOP.
					we are done and do not neet to do any more checking, because we now know that NUMBER is not prime.
				ENDIF.
				we do not have an else, because we are only looping and checking until we find out that the number is not prime. once we know that, we set a flag and continue on.
			LOOPEND.
			IF: check boolean flag IS_PRIME is still true.
				This means that the number was actually Prime.
				PRINT OUT prime number response.
			ENDIF.
			
	
	ELSE: (user did not enter number > 1) 
		print a message: you didn't enter a valid input.
	ENDIF.
	
clean-up:
	Thank the user for playing.
	Close our keyboard resource.
