# Week 1 Challenge

## Description

### Part 1:

The user will have to input a number, and you will display that number. 

You will check if that number is prime and indicate that to the user. 

For example, if the user typed 10, it would display the following output: 

```
10 is not a prime number 
```

### Part 2:

After part 1, in the next part generate a random number between 1 and 250 (you can make this range larger if you'd like).  

As with part 1, you will print the number and print whether it is a prime number.
